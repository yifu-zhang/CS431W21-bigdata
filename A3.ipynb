In this graph, each node represents a server, and each (directed) edge represents a connection between servers in Gnutella's peer-to-peer network.  The input file for this assignment, `p2p-Gnutella08-adj.txt`, represents the graph as an adjacency list.   Each server (node) is identified by a unique number, and each line in the file gives the adjacency list for a single server.\n","For example, this line:\n","> 91\t243\t1923\t2194\n","\n","gives the adjacency list for server `91`.

To get started, you should make sure that you have a clear understanding of ordinary (i.e., non-personalized) page rank.  Read the description of page rank in Section 5.3 of [the course textbook](http://mapreduce.cc/).   Personalized page rank is like ordinary page rank except:\n","- One node in the graph is designated as the *source* node. Personalized page rank is performed with respect to that source node.\n","- Personalized page rank is initialized by assigning all probability mass to the source node, and none to the other nodes. In contrast, ordinary page rank is initialized by giving all nodes the same probability mass.\n","- Whenever personalized page rank makes a random jump, it jumps back to the source node. In contrast, ordinary page rank may jump to any node.\n","- In personalized page rank, all probability mass lost dangling nodes is put back into the source nodes.  In ordinary page rank, lost mass is distributed evenly over all nodes.\n","\n","#### Question 2  (10/24 marks):\n","\n","Your task is to write a Spark program to perform personalized page rank over the Gnutella graph for a specified number of iterations, and of course a specific node.

Just use `cache()`, which caches RDDs at the default persistence level.\n","\n","In addition to adding `cache()` calls in your code, use the text cell below to briefly explain how you decided which RDDs to cache. \n","\n","If you were not able to finish Question 3, add caching annotations to your solution for Question 2 instead."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"A_fRhytv5nBy"},"source":["---\n","#### Your answer to Question 4:\n","\n","Add .cache() after transforming disordered data into trans_adjacent. trans_adjacent is a adjacent list introduced in lecture in RDD form.
